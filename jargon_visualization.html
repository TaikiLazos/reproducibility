            <p>We studied 36 <span class="true-jargon">drop </span><span class="overlap-jargon">seizures</span> in 5 patients with <span class="overlap-jargon">myoclonic astatic epilepsy of early childhood</span> (<span class="overlap-jargon">MAEE</span>) with simultaneous <span class="predicted-jargon">split-screen</span> video recording and <span class="overlap-jargon">polygraph</span>.
Sixteen were <span class="overlap-jargon">falling</span><span class="true-jargon"> attacks</span> and 20 were either less severe attacks exhibiting only deep head nodding or <span class="overlap-jargon">seizures</span> equivalent to <span class="predicted-jargon">drop attacks</span> <span class="true-jargon">in terms of </span><span class="overlap-jargon">ictal pattern</span> but recorded in the <span class="overlap-jargon">supine</span><span class="true-jargon"> position</span>.
All <span class="true-jargon">seizures</span> except those that occurred in patients in the <span class="overlap-jargon">supine</span><span class="true-jargon"> position</span> showed <span class="true-jargon">sudden </span><span class="overlap-jargon">momentary</span><span class="true-jargon"> head dropping</span> or collapse of the whole body downward.
Recovery to the <span class="overlap-jargon">preictal position</span> was observed in 0.3-1 s.
As a result of carefully repeated observations, the 36 <span class="true-jargon">seizures</span> were classified as <span class="overlap-jargon">myoclonic flexor type</span> in 9, <span class="overlap-jargon">myoclonic atonic type</span> in 2, and <span class="overlap-jargon">atonic type</span>, <span class="true-jargon">with and without </span><span class="overlap-jargon">transient preceding symptoms</span> in the remaining 25.
The <span class="overlap-jargon">MF</span><span class="predicted-jargon"> seizure</span> was characterized by sudden <span class="true-jargon">forward </span><span class="overlap-jargon">flexion</span> of the head and <span class="true-jargon">trunk</span> as well as both arms, which caused the patient to fall.
In the <span class="predicted-jargon">myoclonic </span><span class="overlap-jargon">atonic</span><span class="predicted-jargon"> seizure</span>, patients showed <span class="true-jargon">brief</span> <span class="overlap-jargon">myoclonic flexor spasms</span>, immediately followed by <span class="overlap-jargon">atonic falling</span>.
The <span class="overlap-jargon">AT</span><span class="predicted-jargon"> seizure</span> showed <span class="overlap-jargon">abrupt</span><span class="predicted-jargon"> </span><span class="overlap-jargon">atonic falling</span>, with and without <span class="overlap-jargon">transient preceding facial expression</span><span class="true-jargon"> change</span> and/or <span class="overlap-jargon">twitching</span><span class="true-jargon"> of </span><span class="overlap-jargon">extremities</span>.
The <span class="overlap-jargon">ictal EEGs</span> of all 36 <span class="true-jargon">seizures</span> exhibited <span class="overlap-jargon">generalized bilaterally synchronous</span><span class="predicted-jargon"> </span><span class="overlap-jargon">single or multiple spike(s</span><span class="true-jargon">)</span> <span class="predicted-jargon">and wave discharges</span>.
<span class="overlap-jargon">Atonic drop attacks</span> appear to be a common cause of <span class="overlap-jargon">ictal epileptic falling</span> in <span class="overlap-jargon">MAEE</span>.</p>
